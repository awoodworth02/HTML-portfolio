<h1>The Best Movies According to Angie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Notebook</h3>
<p>Great love story even through to the end of their lives.  The husband was always with her even when she didn't know him or remember him.</p>
<h3>The Green Mile</h3>
<p>The accused is arrested for the murder of 2 girls.  His pain for the death of them was confused for guilt instead of his sorrow in not being able to save them.  A symbolism of Christ's love for us and those that were not saved. Guiltless.</p>
<h3>The Greatest Showman</h3>
<p>Great singing and talent with a little history of the Barnum & Bailey Circus and the struggles endured to create the business.</p>
